DIY USB Power Delivery Lab Bench Power Supply

WORK-IN-PROGRESS

This is a power supply with a linear ouput stage and a switching pre regulator.
In the future it will be controlled via a microcontroller doughter board.

The power to the supply is comes from USB Power-delivery at 20V.
The ouput can be set between 0-20V and 0-3A.
